Yoga app using Pose Net

The idea here is to help people in finding out yoga positions. So, i will have implementation of machine learning model PoseNet. The idea is to find out which yoga position they are doing. We can have the app give positions and have the user perform those yoga position. We can check how correctly the user is doing those yoga positions. 
The PoseNet tracks the position of the face, hands, legs and the pelvic,which is pretty much all we need. Let's get into the technicality of stuff:
ML-Model we will use is PoseNet
Framework - React
